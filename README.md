# Multi-Source-Data-with-MIMO-inspired-DPP-MAP-Inference
The implementation of the paper: Learning on Bandwidth Constrained Multi-Source Data with MIMO-inspired DPP MAP Inference

- Run ``` main_new_iid.py ``` for different approaches. Note ```num_repeat=10``` which takes some time for data preparation. 
- Run ``` Show_result.ipynb ``` for summarying the results and get the table.
- output_iid save some example results. You can clear it and run all experiments again.
